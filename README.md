## üß† Generative AI Projects (Personal)

### üîÅ**Two-Stage RAG for Document QA** 
`üü¢ Production Ready - Backend + Frontend`   

**_Problem_:** Companies using AI for document search often suffer from poor precision or high compute costs. Traditional RAG systems either retrieve irrelevant content or waste resources. 

**_Data_:** Enterprise documents used in QA systems, requiring accurate and scalable semantic search.   

**_Solution_:** Designed a two-stage retrieval pipeline combining fast keyword search with precise semantic reranking, using Sentence Transformers and Cross-Encoders. Built with LangChain, ChromaDB, and Docker.   

**_Impact_:**
- Cut retrieval overhead by 75%
- Boosted precision and reduced latency for real-world document QA use cases
- Live demo deployed with a frontend for stakeholders and clients

### üîã**Energy Forecasting with SARIMAX** ([SuperDataScience community project](https://community.superdatascience.com/feed))
`üü¢ Production Ready - Backend + Frontend`  

**_Problem_**: Facility managers and sustainability teams need reliable short-term energy forecasts to optimize planning and reduce costs. However, real-world energy consumption is volatile and only weakly correlated with exogenous drivers like temperature.

**_Data_**: Synthetic building energy dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/energy-consumption-prediction)) with hourly and daily electricity usage, temperature, humidity, and occupancy variables.

**_Solution_**: 
- Built a time-series forecasting pipeline using SARIMAX, including:
- Time-series CV, ADF tests, and outlier detection for robust preprocessing
- Simulation of noisy exogenous inputs via random walks to mimic real-world uncertainty
- SARIMAX trained and benchmarked against ARIMA, achieving R¬≤ ‚âà 0.33 despite injected noise
