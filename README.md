## 🚀 Featured Projects

- [**Two-Stage RAG for Document QA**](https://github.com/bab-git/two-stage-conrag)  
  Scalable RAG pipeline using two-stage retrieval: keyword + semantic search  
  Boosts precision and cuts compute cost. Achieved >75% reduction in retrieval overhead for enterprise-scale QA.  
  *Tech:* RAG, Sentence Transformers, Cross-Encoder Reranker, LangChain, ChromaDB, Docker, Poetry, Streamlit

- [**Energy Forecasting with SARIMAX**](https://github.com/bab-git/SDS-CP027-watt-wise/tree/dev_bob/submissions/team/bob-hosseini)   
  Community project with [**SuperDataScience**](https://community.superdatascience.com/feed) to forecast building energy consumption using a synthetic [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/energy-consumption-prediction).   
  Built a **SARIMAX pipeline** with **uncertainty-injected exogenous inputs** (random walks) and **time-series CV**.   
  App delivers **EDA**, **forecast accuracy**, and **feature relevance** visualizations.   
  ▶️ [Live Streamlit App](https://watt-wise-bob-app.streamlit.app)   
  *Tech:* Python, pandas, statsmodels, SARIMAX, Streamlit, Time-series analysis   

- [**LLM Agents for Clinical Trials**](https://github.com/bab-git/llm_pharma)  
  Agentic LLM pipeline for automating trial eligibility checks and patient-trial matching.  
  Integrates data analysis, compliance verification, and hallucination grading with human-in-the-loop workflows.  
  *Tech:* LangGraph, OpenAI, Pydantic, Gradio

- [**Data Science & ML Mini Tasks**](https://github.com/bab-git/data-science-and-ml-mini-projects)
