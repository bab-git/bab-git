## üß† Generative AI Projects

- [**Two-Stage RAG for Document QA**](https://github.com/bab-git/two-stage-conrag) `üü¢ Production Ready - Backend + Frontend (App)`  
A scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline leveraging two-stage retrieval: keyword and semantic search.  
This approach enhances precision and reduces computational costs, achieving over 75% reduction in retrieval overhead for enterprise-scale QA.
